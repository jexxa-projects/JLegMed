Title: Use of Pipes and Filters Architecture Pattern

Context

We are building a library that acts as a bridge between systems with differing semantics. This scenario typically arises when:
* A legacy system is being incrementally replaced or modernized.
* Multiple bounded contexts emerge in a system designed using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and integration between them is required.

In both cases, we are dealing with data transformations across semantic boundaries. DDDâ€™s context mapping techniques provide strategic guidance for such situations (see Context Mapping).

We need an architectural style that:
* Clearly models data flow and transformations
* Allows composability and separation of concerns
* Works well in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts
* It Can be implemented with minimal dependencies

Decision

We will use the Pipes and Filters architectural pattern.

Each transformation or processing step is implemented as a filter, which receives input, applies a well-defined transformation, and passes the result to the next filter via a pipe.

The implementation will:
* Model flow graph in methods that are part of the main-class so that flow graphs are the entry point
* Strict type-safety so that only filters with the same data structures can be connected
* Represent pipes as first-class citizen, so that it can be accessed for configuration and monitoring purposes  

Consequences
* Pros:
  * Promotes high cohesion and low coupling between processing steps
  * Makes the data flow explicit and easy to reason about
  * Encourages reuse of individual filters
  * Aligns well with functional programming paradigms
  
* Cons:
  * Slightly higher initial design effort compared to monolithic data processing
  * May introduce performance overhead if not optimized in data-intensive operations such as reading data from an old DB stepwise  
* Mitigations:
  * We will benchmark critical flows and optimize or batch filters where necessary
