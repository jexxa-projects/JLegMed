# JLegMedâ€”Connect the Past with the Future

This library is intended to build bridges between systems that do not share the same semantics. 
For example, this can happen when a legacy application is gradually migrated to a modern system or
systems from two different domains need to exchange data. 

Goal is to ensure that a new system is not limited by dependencies to another system. 
In the context of a microservice architecture, this is typically called Anti-Corruption-Layer (ACL).   

For this purpose, we focus on the following aspects:  
* Represent the data flow and transformation as a first-class object in the source code using [pipes and filters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/pipes-and-filters) approach.
* Simplify translating between different technology stacks by 
  * Providing filters based on Java standard APIs
  * Easy integration of new technology stacks   
* Simplify mapping between data sets using a functional style 


## Requirements

*   Java 17+ installed
*   IDE with maven support 


## Quickstart

### Start programming

Below, you see a simple ``Hello World`` example:

```java     
public final class HelloJLegMed
{
    public static void main(String[] args)    {
        var jLegMed = new JLegMed(HelloJLegMed.class);

        jLegMed.newFlowGraph("HelloWorld")
                .every(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)

                .receive(String.class).from( () -> "Hello " )
                .and().processWith(data -> data + "World" )
                .and().consumeWith(data -> getLogger(JLegMedTest.class).info(data));

        jLegMed.run();
    }
}
```    

### Add Dependencies
Whenever possible, JLegMed is developed against standard APIs. This allows an application to use the preferred
technology stacks. Therefore, our application needs two dependencies: `jlegmed` and a logger that fulfills
your requirements, such as `slf4j-simple`.

Maven:
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.jexxa.jlegmed</groupId>
        <artifactId>jlegmed-core</artifactId>
        <version>0.9.0</version>
    </dependency>
    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.9</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Gradle:

```groovy
compile "io.jexxa:jlegmed-core:0.9.0"
compile "org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:2.0.9"
``` 

## Example 

Refer to the following examples to get an idea how this library works
* Typical use cases using `HelloWorld` as an example:
  * [Data processing with a fixed number of iterations (e.g., for testing)](jlegmed-core/src/test/java/io/jexxa/jlegmed/core/flowgraph/RepeatFlowGraphTest.java)
  * [Data processing at a specific interval](jlegmed-core/src/test/java/io/jexxa/jlegmed/core/flowgraph/ReceiveFlowGraphTest.java) 
  * [Await data for processing](jlegmed-core/src/test/java/io/jexxa/jlegmed/core/flowgraph/AwaitFlowGraphTest.java)

* [Configuration of a flowgraph](jlegmed-core/src/test/java/io/jexxa/jlegmed/core/flowgraph/FlowGraphConfigurationTest.java) using `FlowGraphBuilder`
* [Monitoring data flow of a flowgraph](jlegmed-core/src/test/java/io/jexxa/jlegmed/plugins/monitor/FlowGraphMonitorTest.java)

## Build an Application  
* [A template](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaArchetypes) for your first JLegMed application

## Build the library

*   Checkout the new project in your favorite IDE

*   Without running integration tests:
    ```shell
    mvn clean install 
    ```
