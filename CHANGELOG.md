## \[3.5.1] - 2024-11-22
## Fix
- Fixed race condition when accessing ressource pools 
- Updated dependencies

## \[3.5.0] - 2024-11-11
### Added
- New SynchronizedMultiplexer that multiplexes messages if a single message is received on each input. As soon as a message is received on an input. This input blocks and waits until a message is received on the other input or a defined timeout occurs 
- New ThreadedMultiplexer (formerly BiFunctionMultiplexer) that receives as many messages as possible without blocking the input
- Added possibility to define JLEGMED_CONFIG_IMPORT via environment variable

### Changed
- BiFunctionalMultiplexer is set to deprecated -> Use ThreadedMultiplexer instead

## \[3.4.2] - 2024-11-09
### Fixed
- JMSPool: JMSSession is managed per Filter to ensure that only one thread uses the JMSSession
- TCPConnectionPool: A TCPConnection is managed per Filter to ensure that only one thread uses the TCPConnection 


## \[3.4.1] - 2024-11-01
### Fixed
- A flow graph now waits for the interval defined in `every` after an iteration has been run through 
- Updated dependencies

## \[3.4.0] - 2024-10-15
### Added
- TCPSender: Connection timeout can now be defined  
- Possibility to enable strict transactional behavior of flow graphs. Default mode is that flow graphs can run in parallel

### Fixed
-  Forwarding errors to the succeeding filter is now correctly handled. This fixes the issue that an error is not handled by filters that successfully processed the message.

- Updated dependencies

## \[3.3.0] - 2024-10-05
### Added
- TCPSender can now use different delimiters 

### Fixed
- Updated dependencies
- Improved error messages
- TCPListener could be null, if node is not initialized which is now handled correctly.

## \[3.2.1] - 2024-08-31
### Fixed
- Updated dependencies

## \[3.2.0] - 2024-08-02
### Added
- JMSSource supports now all configuration options of JMS2.x. See examples ind [Receiving and sending data from/to JMS](jlegmed-core/src/test/java/io/jexxa/jlegmed/plugins/messaging/jms/MessagingTestIT.java)

## \[3.1.0] - 2024-08-01
### Added
- Statistics about processed messages and processing errors for each flow graph

### Fixed
- Updated dependencies
- When running multiple flow graphs fail fast approach is first validated on all flow graphs before starting them   
- A processing error is now logged if all error pipes are unconnected  

## \[3.0.4] - 2024-07-03
### Fixed
- Updated dependencies

### Incompatible Changes
- Implemented a Fail fast approach as described in [ADR002 - Fail Fast approach](docs/architecture/004-fail-fast-approach.md)
- Processor-Filters in FlowGraphBuilder accept only functional statements. See [ADR 003 - Functional interface processor](docs/architecture/003-functional-interface-processor.md) for more information.
